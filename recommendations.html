          <h4>Research Recommendations:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Urban Air Mobility (UAM) research should be continued</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Small aircraft that seat 6 or less may appeal to people who are worried about their safety</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles (EVTOLS)</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Research on how the public would respond to Urban Air Mobility</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Increasing air traffic control (ATC) effienciency should continue</li>
            <ul>
              <li>UAM would require ATC infrastructure</li>
              <li>More private chartered flights for social distancing</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Smaller aircraft with less passengers may mean increase in air traffic</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Research that would support this development are projects such as NextGen, ATD-2, and testing done in
                the Air Traffic Control Simulator</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Research on Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management should continue</li>
            <ul>
              <li>More people can stay at home and receive deliveries</li>
              <li>Delivery with less contact</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <h4>Guidelines For The Future:</h4>
  
          <h4>Safety</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>In the case of a pandemic or health crisis, airlines should promote safety in airports and aircraft:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Information about where it has originated, how it is spread, and how to prevent the spread of the virus
                should be prominently displayed as soon as possible</li>
              <li>Airlines should also require masks, social distancing, and sanitation once the virus is seen to be a
                threat</li>
              <li>Flexible booking should be put in place, as it allows someone who is sick to cancel their flight and
                therefore, protect others from exposure</li>
              <li>Travel documents should be digital in order to minimize contact between people</li>
              <li>There should be protocols in place for biometric testing</li>
              <li>Contact tracing should be in place to warn passengers who were in close proximity to someone who has a
                virus</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
  
          <h4>Recommendations to Protect Economic Interests:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Build Customer Confidence</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Safety guidelines help protect passengers and airline workers and improve customer confidence</li>
              <li>An increase in customer confidence can lead to an increase in bookings</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Create flexibility for aircraft usage</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Cargo shipping has not been as affected as passenger travel</li>
              <li>Strip seats from passenger planes to ship cargo</li>
              <li>Integrate cargo shipping with passenger planes to establish flexibility for the future</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
