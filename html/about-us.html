            Lexington High School in Lexington, MA. He is a passionate learner who loves to apply his knowledge in real-world scenarios. 
            His interests lie within the intersection of artificial Intelligence, data analysis, and autonomous Drones, and he loves 
            to work on projects involving these topics in his free time. He also enjoys building props and other structures, 
            and tinkering around with various other hands-on projects as a hobby, giving him insight into the aspects of engineering.<br><br>Vikram 
            helped gather information on the air cargo portion of the project. He mainly contributed to creating the graphs for 
            the website and making them interactive.</h3>
